Hi! My name is Ricardo, I'm software developer and I'm from Barcelona. One thing about me is that I love to learn things on my own. In this GitHub page you can see a bunch of projects that I have started or contributed plus more of them that are in private mode 🤐.

# 💡 Seeking ideas

Currently I'm more focused on my work (I work for a company based here in Barcelona). But I'm open to new ideas, to merge with people with fresh ideas that want to be developed.
